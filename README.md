# Three-games-in-one-function--Reinforcement-Learning
<br />

## Description

In this project, we did three games in one function. These games or two-player matrix games include: <br /> **Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma**, **Matching pennies** & **Rock-Paper-Scissors** <br />
Useful bits of knowledge before start:

## Introduction 

I should note that for all games, selected parameters are identical. The learning rate alpha = 0:01, the iteration is 40,000 and each Game is learned for 5 Trials. This provides the neater coding as well as better comparison. I also preferred to put the extra graphs for value trends in page 4 which is provided for more information and
is also useful to support some explanation.
